        About the Shared Channels Experience strategy
      </h2>

      <p>In Shared Channels Experience, our mission is to make everyone’s
        interaction with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) as useful
        and simple as possible, regardless of any underlying complexity.</p>

      <p>This means we will work across the entire DWP landscape to make sure
        people can trust the department to meet their needs.<p>

      <p>Our aim is to reassure them at every step of the conversation –
        wherever that conversation happens – that we understand their personal
        situation and will offer the right support as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p>It also means collaborating with teams to build simple, secure,
        efficient, inclusive services that seamlessly incorporate policy-specific
        variations to any user’s overarching experience.</p>

      <p>This is so that, while the benefit or outcome might differ according to
        a user’s needs, the way we get them there is consistent and coherent.</p>

      <p>This strategy explains what we're going to do to achieve our mission
          over the next 3 years and beyond.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        What achieving this strategy will look like in real life
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">If we meet all the goals of our strategy, it will mean:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>problem 1</li>
          <li>problem 2</li>
          <li>problem 3</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
          Increased trust in digital information
        </h3>
      <p>Allowing for more complex tasks to be completed online / providing appropriate records of past interactions for both agents and customers, could dramatically reduce call wait times.</p>
      <p>Many customers report feeling ‘driven’ to the phones – customers report not being able to ‘trust’ online processes e.g. because responses are automated and don’t appear to be acted on or because there is no audit trail which can make it difficult to progress issues.</p>
      <p>Some customers do prefer / need to contact DWP by phone – where those who prefer digital options are able to do so, this would reduce call wait times for those remaining.</p>
      <p>It is noted that Local Authorities recently identified a need for a dedicated DWP phone number for them to use, as they could not afford to wait the often 40 minutes or longer it would take to get through. A better solution would of course be to <strong>reduce this wait time for everyone</strong>.</p>
      <p>Digital offers will only be effective if there is appropriate monitoring / responsiveness. As already noted (customer view research), near 20% of phone traffic may be attributable to people chasing up DWP due to lack of information / response.</p>
      <p>Inappropriate automated responses are reported by users as a key reason they may avoid or not trust online (meaning they may follow-up with a phone-call).</p>
      <p>Timeliness of response is also a key driver with users reporting a lack of timely response through the UC journal – this tool is of course not designed for this kind of quick response but highlights this as a key customer need.
Further automation and standardisation could reduce inconsistency of experience and make DWP a fairer service. Third sector organisations have reported advising customers to reapply if they are turned down for benefits, rather than appeal – they report that this is because so much depends on the judgement of individual agents that the customer may just get a different response if they get someone else. Interviews with agents also reveal a high degree of inconsistency e.g. one agent reporting that they would automatically stop a maternity claim if the customer was Eastern European with others reporting that they would always have a thorough conversation with a customer before stopping a claim (where possible).
Better recording and access to relevant information would allow agents to provide a more consistent service to users, even if multiple agents are involved. Inconsistency in recording / access to information leaves customers feeling like they’re starting again every time the contact DWP – this has included some very sensitive cases e.g. one woman forced to repeat details of rape, when explaining why she is eligible for additional child credit.
Consistent application of contact preferences could avoid distress, especially for customers with additional support needs. Lack of recognition of neurodiversity has recently been a key issue raised, partially in relation to eligibility but also in our methods of communication e.g. customer has registered a preference to communicate via email only and then receives a text message saying they need to call immediately with no explanation.
Customers would be more likely to have any additional needs met if we told agents what they needed instead of only listing a ‘vulnerability’. Where additional needs / support considerations are recorded, these are often unhelpful to agents e.g. a customer is noted as ‘hard of hearing’ without guidance on whether this means to speak louder, to only communicate via written means or that a friend of family member will act as an informal appointee. The UC Barriers work particularly, provides a lot of information on how we build these kinds of barriers in to our products.
Building sensitivity into communications could reduce distress and the risk of making people more vulnerable. True design around user needs means both building in support and building out harm. Lack of consideration in the way automated processes are designed, has resulted in customers being directly harmed, not just unsupported e.g. chasing overpayments where a customer has died and the comment on social media re renewals - “….don’t sent PIP renewal forms just before Christmas with a return date just after Christmas!! They have taken ages to completely spoiled my very ill daughter’s Christmas. They couldn’t have waited 2 weeks!! I’m sure it’s deliberate!”
Improving consistency of the digital offer is a key way in which we could improve trust. The majority of customer trust appears to be dependent on their general feelings about the Government and DWP. Some of this relates to the above re audit trails / not having to start again or feel they have to fight to be heard. In designing products, consistency has come up repeatedly inc. ensuring Gov branding is clear and consistent throughout the journey. This a major opportunity but also risk in building the ARA.
Joining up information would reduce the amount of customer contact needed. Some benefit lines are insufficiently joined up to allow a ‘tell us once’ approach (beyond notification of death) e.g. customer comment – “So DWP have Cancelled my P.I.P. as I did not inform them of change of address yet I did this on my U.C. account. Surely in this modern age why can’t the P.I.P. computer speak to the Universal Credit computer, so now have to wait for up to 20 weeks”. Even where policy specifies that updates should be shared amongst benefit lines, this is not always done e.g. some agents report saying that they can see where customer information has been updated by another benefit line (via Searchlight) but that they won’t accept it until the customer contacts them directly. Some processes around data sharing appear set up to fail e.g. Research in the Dead Letter Office demonstrated that if a Local Authority informs DWP of a change of address, DWP will register that there has been an address change but not what the new address is. A letter is sent to the old address to ask for the new address. When there is no response, the benefit is stopped – there is provision for an agent to pause the stop and attempt to contact the customer by other means but this requires than an agent proactively check the customer records identified as reaching the DLO / scheduled for closure due to no response, which often doesn’t happen.</p>

  What this strategy does not focus on
</h2>

<p>Product-specific strategies – we should be signposting product people on from
  this document.<p>

<p>We won’t be building anything directly, but supporting those who do –
  actually we’re the ONLY people building things, so we need to make sure we’re
  providing guiderails etc</p>
